This repo contains all the pipelines I made during my Master of Science: Data Science, Artificial Inteligence & Digital Business.
<br /> Which demonstrates my knowledge and experience with:
- supervised & unsupervised machine learning algoritms (such as K-means, KNN, Neural Networks, SVM)
- NLP: tokenizing, vectorizing, classifying and analyzing textual data
- building a CNN for binary image classification
- preprocessing, analyzing and visualizing big data
- pandas, plotly, sklearn, tensorflow, matplotlib, nltk, numpy, imblearn

- **M504: Artificial intelligence**
<br /> an exploratory data analysis pipeline with the following parts:
  * data exploration
  * data preprocessing
  * data analysis
  
  <a/> using the libraries pandas & plotly
  
  
- **M505: Machine learning**
<br /> a supervised machine learning pipeline with the following parts:
  * data exploration
  * data preprocessing + feature engineering step
  * model selection + hyperparameter tuning
  * model assessment step to eveluate performance of the model
  * feature importance analysis
  
  <a/> using the libraries **pandas, plotly, sklearn, matplotlib**
  <br /> using supervised regression algorithms such as KNN, SVM & Linear Regression
  
  
- **M507: Methods of Prediction**
